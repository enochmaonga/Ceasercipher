CeaserCipher APP
The Caesar cipher is named after the legendary Roman emperor Julius Caesar, who used it to protect his military communications. It is a simple substitution cipher, where each letter corresponds to another letter a certain number of positions forward or backward in the alphabet. For example, a shift right of 5 would encode the word Caesar as “hfjxfw”. Due to this simplicity, the Caesar cipher offers little security against those with even a passing knowledge of cryptography.

My Project will seek to make a simple app where you key in plain text and it prints the ceaser Cipher codeded out put.

this app works with the following scale of the alphabet 
Plain A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 
Cipher X Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W 
Index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
21 22 23 24 25

How this App works:
Once you click run, you will be prompted to enter a plain text:
-Enter any letter from the 26 alphabets
Click enter:
You will be prompted to enter a Key.
- A key is any number that you will want the letters to shift, for example if you enter letter A and enter key 1
you expect A to shift once to the right, and it will land at B, so the outcome will be B. So B will be your Cipher text and so on.

- This app will be run on Java and its related dependencies.
- The App was built on Java and gradle.
- You will be required to open it on IntelliJ.
